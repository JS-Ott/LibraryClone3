# Library Catalog 3
A library catalog app for Android 7.0. This version is several generations removed from the original, which ran on a rooted Nook Simple Touch ereader with an e-ink screen.

## Testing

1. Install /app/app-release.apk on your Android 7.0 phone or emulator. You must use a device with at least version 7.0, since the app make use of Androids new permission requesting functionality.

2. Copy /SampleLibrary.db to your device.

3. Tap the menu button and select "Import from database". Browse to SampleLibrary.db and choose it. The import process may take several seconds, even on a newer phone.
